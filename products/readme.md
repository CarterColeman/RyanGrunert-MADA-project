This project directory contains all of the products of the project. It contains the references used for the
 project as well as a metadata file that contains all the metadata for every raw dataset used in the 
 analysis.
 
 In the manuscript folder, there contains the main .Rmd file and a microsoft word output for the
 manuscript. You can completely recreate the full analysis project from raw_data to completion from
 within the Manuscript.Rmd file. However, if you should choose to use that method after running each
  individual script in the code directory, make sure to clear the environment before attempting to run all
  the code in the Manuscript.Rmd file.
